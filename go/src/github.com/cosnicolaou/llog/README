Low level implementation of leveled execution logs for Go.

It is a fork of the github.com/golang/glog (c6f9652c7179652e2fd8ed7002330db089f4c9db) package that is itself an efficient pure Go implementation of leveled
logs in the manner of the open source C++ package

	http://code.google.com/p/google-glog

This version refactors the code so as not to rely on a single global variable
and associated log state. It also separates out the flag parsing so that
an application can chose to use whatever command line flags they wish to
configure the package.
