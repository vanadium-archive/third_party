To build and use the plugin:
- Run: mvn install
- Upload target/vanadium_kubernetes.hpi to Jenkins using "Upload Plugin" at:
  http://dev.v.io/jenkins/pluginManager/advanced.
- Check the "restart Jenkins" checkbox. Jenkins will wait until there are
  no pending jobs before restarting, this might take some time during busy
  periods.
